## URL Shortener Application
This repository contains a simple URL shortening service using Python and Flask. The application consists out of three Python files: url_shortener.py, helpers.py, and auth.py. The url_shortener.py file contains the URLShortenerApp class, which is responsible for handling the core functionality of the service. The helpers.py file provides utility functions such as validating URLs and generating unique identifiers. The auth.py file handles user authentication and authorization, including managing user roles and validating JWT tokens.

This RESTful API takes long URLs as input and enables users to create, update, and delete shortened URLs. The shortened URLs contain a URI generated by a combination of ASCII letters and digits. The length of this URI can be specified as a parameter and defaults to 8. The user can also specify the parameters for the maximum attempts of generating URI's, and the maximum length of of the input URLs. 

The application features the following functionalities: 
* Validating URLs
* Generating unique identifiers
* Checking for collisions between identifiers
* Creating, updating, and deleting shortened URLs using role-based access control (RBAC)
* Searching and viewing all stored URLs with their corresponding URI's and timestamps
* Authenticating users with JWT tokens
* Creating users with specified access roles
* Logging in and updating passwords of users

### Requirements
* Python 3.8.8
* pip 22.3.1
* List of other required libraries and their versions (see below)

### Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the provided Python files to your local machine.
2. Install the virtualenv package by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```console
pip install virtualenv
```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```console
virtualenv env_name
source env_name/bin/activate # Mac or Linux
env_name\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows
```
4. Install the specified Flask version using pip (assuming pip is installed):
```console
pip install Flask==1.1.2
```
5. Install the other required libraries:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Run the Flask app:
```console
python app.py
```

### Testing
The URL shortener application includes a test class that covers most of the core functionalities. The tests consists out of three Python files: test_app.py, test_auth.py, test_helpers.py. These test suites cover, among others, the following functionalities:
* Validation and generation of short URLs
* Retrieval of short URLs
* Redirection, updating, and deletion of short URLs
* Error handling for invalid input, unsupported requests, and non-existent unique identifiers
* Creating users
* User login
* Valid username and password
* Updating passwords of users
* Requirements of authorization

### Running Tests
To run the tests, execute the following commands from your terminal:
```console
python -m unittest test_app.py
python -m unittest test_auth.py
python -m unittest test_helpers.py
```

### Limitations
The application stores data into a dictionary which may not scale well if the number of entries increases. Dictionaries are in-memory data structures, and could cause performance issues or limitations in memory. A more efficient and scalable solution would be to use a database to store the data. For example, a relational database management system (RDBMS) or a NoSQL database.

Additionally, there is an trade-off between the length of the generated URI and the possibility of collisions. A collision occurs when two different input URLs are assigned to the same URI. Shorter URIs are more user-friendly and require less storage, but they also increase the probability of collisions. When the number of unique URIs increases, the probability of collisions also increases. This could lead to potential issues in the functionality of the application. To address this issue, the application can integrate a more sophisticated algorithm for producing URIs, or modify the length of the generated URIs by adjusting the current algorithm's parameter. However, increasing the length of the URIs may result into shortened URLs that are less convenient.
