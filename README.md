## URL Shortener App
This is a simple URL shortening application built using Python and the Flask framework. This application takes long URLs and enables users to create, update, and delete shortened URLs. It also features additional functionality, such as viewing all stored URLs with the corresponding URI's and timestamps. To make it easier for users to interact with the application, we have created a simple user interface that can be accessed from a web browser on your local machine. This UI allows users to input long URLs, generate a shortened URL, update and delete the URLs, and view all URLs.
